The solution often involves a combination of checks and corrections:

1. **Verify Package Installation:**  Ensure all necessary packages are correctly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  Double-check the versions specified in your `package.json` to ensure compatibility.
2. **Check `package.json`:**  Carefully review your `package.json` for any typos or inconsistencies in module names or versions.  Ensure that all dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies are correctly listed and that there are no version conflicts.
3. **Clean the Cache:** Sometimes, a corrupted cache can cause module resolution issues. Try running `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo cache.
4. **Resolve Dependencies:**  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate the dependency tree and identify any circular dependencies or conflicting versions.  Resolving these conflicts often requires careful consideration of package versions and dependency management strategies.
5. **Check `metro.config.js` (if applicable):**  If you have a custom Metro configuration (`metro.config.js`), verify that it's correctly configured to resolve modules and handle aliases.
6. **Restart and Rebuild:** After making changes, restart your Expo development server (`expo start`) and let it rebuild your project.

Here's an example of a corrected `package.json` (assuming the issue was related to `react-native-reanimated`):
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-reanimated": "^2.14.4", // Or the appropriate version
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```
By meticulously checking these points, you should be able to pinpoint the reason behind the module resolution error and effectively resolve it.
