# Expo CLI Module Resolution Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo CLI: module resolution failures.  These errors typically occur when a module or package required by your application cannot be found or properly linked during the build process.  The root cause can often be traced to inconsistencies in your project's `package.json`, incorrect configurations, or problems within your project's dependency tree.

The `bug.js` file showcases an example scenario where a module dependency is incorrectly configured or missing.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected solution, demonstrating how to resolve the issue by ensuring correct package installations, configurations, and dependency management.

## How to Reproduce the Bug:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run the application using `expo start`. You should observe an error related to missing modules. 

## Solution:

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code. The primary solution generally involves ensuring that all required packages are correctly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`, checking for any typos or inconsistencies in your `package.json` file, and resolving any conflicts or circular dependencies within your project's dependency tree. In some cases, cleaning your project's cache may also help (`expo prebuild --clean`).
